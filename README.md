# Image-Super-Resolution-using-GAN
Conducted adversarial training and utilized perceptual loss in training neural network-based generator and discriminator models for image enhancement using SRGAN and ESRGAN. Conducted a comparative analysis of model features and evaluated performance based on image quality metrics, including PSNR and SSIM
